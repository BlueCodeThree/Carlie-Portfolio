### Design process

My initial ideas for the website were:

- One column design - desktop mode possibly having a sidebar navigation
- [Parallax image](https://alligator.io/css/pure-css-parallax/) at the top of the site (below navigation)
- Navy blue background, with hot pink highlights/accents on the page.
- The overall website having a professional feel but also unique and stand out with the colour pallet.

#### Mood Board

I chose navy blue because it is my favourite colour and hot pink because that is the colour of my jumper. I like to stand out in photos with my bright hot pink jumper, it has become a bit of a signature colour for me.
